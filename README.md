# TournamentBracket
This script generates a bracket tournament with 8 teams, where each team is represented by a number from 1 to 8. The bracket is stored as a dictionary, with keys for each round and values as lists of tuples representing the match-ups for that round. The script generates the bracket by starting with the first round and working its way up to the final match.
You can modify the script to use different team names, or to generate brackets with a different number of teams.
